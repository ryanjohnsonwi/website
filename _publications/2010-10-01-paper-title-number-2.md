In the summer of 2020 Adrienne Daeger, who was working as the research program specialist at Lakes and Streams at that time, asked me for help with the statistics she was working on.  She was trying to rewrite a paper that had been rejected from the The Lake and Reservoir Management Journal.  My part of the project was to address the followingnote from the reviewer.
> The statement about not doing statistical comparison due to economic limitations and
> inadequate replication will be a problem. Not having money to do something right is not an
> excuse. If replication is inadequate for any testing (not at all sure that is correct), then all you
> can say is that the changes were large enough or small enough to not seem to need statistical
> testing to draw a conclusion, but I think reviewers will disagree. You took averages of what
> seems to be 3 measurements, so you have some replication, and even with just 3
> measurements you can do statistical analysis, just with a lower power to detect differences. If
> your individual sample results are highly variable, you may fail to detect a difference because of
> inadequate sampling, but the averages reported in the tables do not suggest any problem. There
> are either minimal differences or big differences. Some measure of variance is needed,
> however, for reviewers to determine if those differences are real or not. If all of the pre-run
> values are lower than the post-run values, there isnâ€™t much question about the averages being

I wrote the new data analysis portion of the paper and created figures 3, 4, 5, and 6.  The paper was published in the 2022 edition of the Proceedings of the Indiana Academy of Science, and can be downloaded [here](files\nutrient-and-sediment-resuspension.pdf).

The difficulty with this paper was that the design of the original project ran at least 28 experiments in which different boats were run at different speeds, at different depths, with different compositions of the bottom substrate of the lake, yet only three water samples were taken before and after each boat run, and a couple of these had to be discarded because they had been contaminated.

With such small data sets, it was important to communicate the amount of uncertainty regarding the effects that we did or did not measure in each experiment.  It was a matter of scientific integrity that we refrained from jumping to conclusions in situations where we might be observing a "lucky roll of the dice" rather than a true scientific effect.  Thus, we needed to communicate all of our data clearly to the reader with sufficient reminders of potential randomness.  Ultimately, I made the choice to rely more heavily on graphs that showed the true data, the calculated averages, and error bars around the calculated averages.  This is why the section of the paper that I wrote is very short, but the figures I created take up four pages.

For example, in the portion of figure 3 below, each column of graphs is from a different part of lake Wawasee with a different substrate at the bottom.  Each row is a different substance measured in the water samples.  Each black triangle is a measurement at 0.5 meters below the surface and each black dot is a measurement at the surface of the lake.  Each white diamond is calculated average of three (and occasionally two) measurements.  The error bars show the 95% confidence interval for each mean.  The average before the boat ran through is always on the left, and the average afterwards is always on the right, and they are connected with a straight line so that you can see more clearly when a change was measured.  As you can see below, there are multiple times the average measurement changed after the boat ran through the water, but our samples are too small to conclude those changes were statistically significant.

This approach to presenting the data, along with the other improvements from the other coauthors, were apparently satisfying to the reviewers of Proceedings of the Indiana Academy of Science, and we were about to publish this previously-rejected paper.
