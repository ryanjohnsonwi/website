excerpt: 'We prove that the higher Frobenius–Schur indicators, introduced by Ng and Schauenburg, give a strong-enough invariant to distinguish between any two Tambara–Yamagami fusion categories. Our proofs are based on computation of the higher indicators in terms of Gauss sums for certain quadratic forms on finite abelian groups and rely on the classification of quadratic forms on finite abelian groups, due to Wall.

As a corollary to our work, we prove a conjecture by Turaev and Vainerman is false.'
